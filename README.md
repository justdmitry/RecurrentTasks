# RecurrentTasks

This lightweight library allows you to run simple background tasks with specified intervals in your ASP.NET application. 

Each task is a separate `Task`, which sleeps in background for a while, wakes up, perform some job and sleeps again.

Ideal, when you don't need to run many/heavy tasks and don't want to use "big" solutions with persistence and other bells and whistles.

Optimized for **NET 8.0** ([v5.0.0 release](https://github.com/justdmitry/RecurrentTasks/releases/tag/v5.0.0) if you need support for ASP.NET 5, ASP.NET Core 1.0 and 2.0; or [v6.6.0 release](https://github.com/justdmitry/RecurrentTasks/releases/tag/v6.6.0) for `net7`, `net6` or `netstandard2.0`).

## Main features

* TargetFramework: `net8.0` (use older versions for previous frameworks);
* Start and Stop your task at any time;
* [`IHostedService`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/multi-container-microservice-net-applications/background-tasks-with-ihostedservice) implemented for NET Core 2.0 (and above) app lifetime support
* CancelationToken may be used for Stopping;
* First run (after Start) is delayed at random value (10-30 sec, customizable) to prevent app freeze during statup;
* Run "immediately" (without waiting for next scheduled time);
* Change run interval while running;
* Single-execution-at-a-time: A task already running will wait before running again (timer for "next" run will start only after "current" run completes);
* `RunStatus` property contains:
    * last/next run times;
    * last run result (success / exception);
    * last success run time;
    * last exception;
    * total failed runs counter.

## Usage

### 1. Create new task class

```csharp
public class MyFirstTask : IRunnable
{
    private ILogger logger;

    public MyFirstTask(ILogger<MyFirstTask> logger)
    {
        this.logger = logger;
    }
    
    public Task RunAsync(ITask currentTask, IServiceProvider scopeServiceProvider, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Place your code here
    }
}
```

You can add any parameters to constructor, while they are resolvable from DI container (including scope-lifetime services, because new scope is created for every task run).

By default, new instance of `IRunnable` is created for every task run, but you may change lifetime in `AddTask` (see below). Use `IServiceProvider` passed to `RunAsync` to obtain scope-wide services if you force your task be singleton.

### 2. Register and start your task in `Startup.cs`


```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    ...
    services.AddTask<MyFirstTask>(o => o.AutoStart(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)));
    ...
}

```

And voila! Your task will run every 5 minutes. Until your application ends, of course.

`AddTask` adds your `MyFirstTask` to DI container with transient lifetime (new instance will be created for every task run). Pass desired lifetime to `AddTask()` to override: 
```csharp
services.AddTask<MyFirstTask>(
  o => o.AutoStart(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)),
  ServiceLifetime.Singleton)`.
```

### Run immediately

Anywhere in you app:

```csharp
// obtain reference to your task
var myTask = serviceProvider.GetService<ITask<MyFirstTask>>();

// poke it
if (myTask.IsStarted)
{
    myTask.TryRunImmediately();
}
```
